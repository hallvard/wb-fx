# Welcome

Welcome to this workbench!

The workbench provides a set of *view* (see [list](views.md)) that allow you to explore various elements of Langchain4J and related libraries. The views are organised in *tab groups*. Initially, only some view are shown, but more may be opened from the **View** menu. The tabs may be dragged and docked so you can get a layout suitable for your task (see [demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panemu/tiwulfx-dock/main/media/tiwulfx-dock-demo.gif) at the underlying [tiwulfx-dock library site](https://github.com/panemu/tiwulfx-dock)).

Views may be *linked* so one may provide data to another. When a view is opened, it is automatically linked to other views that provide data it needs, but you can link or unlink manually, if needed (see [linking views](linking-views.md)).

Most views have an info page, right-click on the tab and select the **Info** menu item to check it out.

The workbench is a [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) application built on [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) with [quarkus-fx](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-fx).
